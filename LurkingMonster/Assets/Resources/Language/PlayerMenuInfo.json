          "Value": "Land subsidence is the gradual settling or sudden sinking of the Earth’s surface, due to underground material movement. It is often caused by the removal of water, oil, natural gas or mineral resources out of the ground by pumping, fracking, or mining activities. Last but not least, it can also be caused by natural phenomena, such as earthquakes, soil compaction, glacial isostatic adjustment etc. (What Is Subsidence?, n.d.) \n <b>Subsidence in the Netherlands:</b> Urban areas like Rotterdam, Gouda and Utrecht are sinking as they were built on weak soil as well (Kennislink, 2014).  Additionally, the soil in Amsterdam is very soft and buildings are created on stones that have a wooden foundation underneath. The main cause of the rotting of the poles is because of the groundwater level getting lower This can happen due to leaky, draining sewers, drains that are set too low, lowering the surface water, drainage and construction pits. (pg.5 guide KCAF) This means the wood can age, deteriorate or even mould over the years and lead to subsidence which can be saved by fixing the foundation (City of Amsterdam, n.d.). \n <b>Common visible effects of subsidence</b> \n • Large cracks in a wall, usually around a door or window frame, which are wider at the top than they are at the bottom. \n • These cracks are usually more than 3mm wide. \n • Cracks in the pavement/walls outside. \n • Doors and windows sticking \n • Sloping floors - this is common in older properties \n • If you have an extension, look for cracks where the extension meets the main part of the house."

If you suspect these problems might affect your living accommodation, we would advise you to follow this guide and take action. \n <b>1. Research local archives</b>\n The first step is going to the town hall to research your location and building and get the necessary data on additional changes that could have been made over the years.\n <b> 2. Consultation of co-owners of the building</b> \n If there is no information to be found in the town hall archives, the next step would be to get into contact with previous owners and discuss options with other people that share the building (semi detached houses, or terraced houses). \n "
